config STM_COPROCESSOR_CLASS
	tristate "STMicroelectronics coprocessor support"
	select FW_LOADER
	select BPA2
	select LIBELF_32
	---help---
	  Many of the ST system-on-chip devices have multiple CPUs, where a
	  master CPU running Linux has control over a number of slave CPUs,
	  which are usually used to run dedicated algorithms.
	  Enabling this option will add support to the Linux kernel to
	  control these slave CPUs, reserve memory for them, and thus allow
	  code to be downloaded onto them and executed.

	  Memory allocation is managed through BPA2 so, to define a
	  coprocessor's memory size and address, use the normal BPA2
	  command line option:
	    bpa2_parts=<name0>:<size0>:<address0>,<name1>:<size1>:<address1>,...
	  where:
	    <nameX> is "coproc_" followed by the coprocessor name, for example
	    "audio0".
	    <sizeX> defines the size of the partition
	    <addressX> defines the base address of memory reserved for the
	    coprocessor application code and data.

	  For example:
	    bpa2_parts=coproc_video0:16m:0x06000000,coproc_audio0:16m:0x07000000

	  As with all other BPA2 addresses, addresses are physical addresses,
	  and so may appear at different virtual addresses when mapped into the
	  CPU's memory map.

          addresses and operations you are using for coprocessor.

config STM_RNG
       bool "STM Random Number Generator Support"
       default y
       ---help---
         This option adds support for the hardware Random Number Generator
         (RNG) present on different STMicroelectronics SoCs.  It allows the
         RNG to feed /dev/random with entropy thereby ensuring real
         random numbers from this device.

         Without this option, /dev/random has little entropy and is not
         useful.  In fact, it may block for a long time while waiting for
         entropy.

         This option should always be enabled for relevant SoCs.

         This option can be used in conjunction with the /dev/hw_random
         driver found in the char drivers menu.

	  This option enables the STMicroelectronics Power Management

	  This is a kernel framework based around power profiles (pms_state),
	  where the designer can specify devices power states and the
	  clock frequency rates.

	  tune the power consumption according with what the system is doing.

	  Enable this option if the state group has to be controlled.
